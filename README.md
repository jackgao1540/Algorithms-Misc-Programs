# Algorithms and Miscellanous Programs
Random algorithms and programs I found interesting to make!

*Run the .exe's instead of running the C++ code in an IDE; it's much faster and easier to use. My apologies if that is too obvious.*

# Current list:
* Bracket Validator (some Toronto slang involved)
* Breadth-First Search
* Dot Product
* Knapsack/Dynamic Programming
  * *I attempted to make this more interesting than the traditional knapsack problem by allowing duplicate items and making item values diminish by a certain value as you take more of the same item. However, it appears my solution is not quite correct and I'll have to fix that at some point.*
